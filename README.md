# Hydrogen–Deuterium Isotope Shift (Balmer Series)

High-resolution spectroscopy lab project (UCSB Physics) measuring the wavelength isotope shift between hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D) in the Balmer series using a **scanning monochromator** and **PMT** readout.

**Authors:** Hongyu Wang, Cici Zhang  
**Advisor:** Philip Lubin (Department of Physics, UC Santa Barbara)

## Key Day 4 results (new lamp)
Final results (including scan-rate calibration systematics):

- **Hα:** Δλ = 1.801 ± 0.052 Å  
- **Hβ:** Δλ = 1.263 ± 0.039 Å  

These values match the final report PDF in `report/`.

## Repository layout
- `report/`
  - `HD_final_report.pdf` — final submitted report (PDF)
  - `src/` — LaTeX source (optional; if you regenerate)
  - `figures/` — figures used in the report / regenerated by scripts
- `data/`
  - `hg/day1/`, `hg/day2/` — Hg lamp calibration scans
  - `hd/day3_old_lamp/` — “old” H–D lamp (lower SNR control)
  - `hd/day4_new_lamp/` — “new” H–D lamp (final measurement)
  - `metadata.csv` — one-row-per-file metadata table
- `analysis/`
  - scripts for recomputing tables and (optionally) refitting raw scans
- `results/`
  - generated tables / summary CSV/JSON (created by analysis scripts)
- `notes/`
  - lab notebook export and screenshots

## Reproducing the tables in the report (recommended)
The most robust way to reproduce Table II/III from the final report is to recompute them from the recorded **Day 4 trial shifts** and the stated calibration uncertainty model.

```bash
cd analysis
python recompute_tables_day4.py
```

This writes:
- `results/day4_tableII_compare.csv`
- `results/day4_tableIII_error_budget.csv`
- `results/day4_summary.json`

## Optional: fitting raw scans
Raw CSVs contain two columns: time (s), detector signal (V).  
Automated two-Gaussian fitting of **partially overlapping doublets** can be sensitive to:
- time-window selection,
- baseline drift,
- local minima in nonlinear least squares.

The script `fit_from_raw.py` provides a starting point. For publication-quality reproducibility, it is recommended to specify a per-file time window in `analysis/windows.yaml`.

## Notes on sharing course materials
This repo **does not include the UCSB course lab manual PDF**, because it is copyrighted course material.
